---> Preparing the Android device
    "You will need an Android device to run your React Native Android app. This can be either a physical Android device, or more commonly, you can use an Android Virtual Device which allows you to emulate an Android device on your computer.
Either way, you will need to prepare the device to run Android apps for development."

---> Using a physical device
  If you have a physical Android device, you can use it for development in place of an AVD by plugging it in to your computer using a USB cable
  
  
(now I assume that you know how to connect mobile with laptop through USB for debugging process)

---> Running your React Native application
Step 1 : Start Metro using this command:-
                                         npx react-native start
(now go to application folder using "cd" commanc)

Step 2: Start your application using following command:-
                                                        npx react-native run-android


That's it  !!!!!
